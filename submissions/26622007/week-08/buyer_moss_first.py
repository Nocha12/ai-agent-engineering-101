"""Default-OFF order-level A/B: moss-and-oak's first turn priced by code (arm B) or by the harness (arm A, legacy).

moss-and-oak quotes "<name> (<SKU>), <grade, warranty>, market certificate attached. Also in stock in this category:
<SKUs>. Send your offer as a number, or reply 'accept' to buy now. Asking: N." market_buyer reads N (also_in_stock_only),
but ask_read reads one SKU's quotes only, so oneshot.text_price leaves that first turn to the harness: 77 of 127 moss
talks 11/09 01:33 - 11/10 05:30 opened by the harness at a median 0.673 of the ask, 26 ending in a deal; the 50 opened by
code (a metadata ask) at 0.90, 50 deals, 46 of them food (GPT Pro mw9q5kxg §2, W-20261109-2225-AXPro주기). Food against
goods and the hour differ between those groups, so what 0.90 does to goods talks is not known: this study measures it.
- switch .market/buyer_moss_first.json {"enabled": true, "salt": "...", "start": epoch, "end": epoch}; anything else, or a
  window that is not finite, not started, over, shorter than MIN_HOURS or longer than MAX_HOURS, is off. The end is fixed
  before the start (GPT Pro mw9q5kxg §4.1: 9 h minimum, 12 h maximum);
- arm = sha256("buyer_moss_first:" + salt + ":" + order)[0] % 2 (A legacy, B code); every order started in the window is
  assigned (ITT), whatever shop it picks;
- only the first turn of a talk with moss-and-oak (the shop I picked, by its name in my shop list, not by its text) on its
  whole quote that code left to the harness (no metadata ask, no code answer, the ask read is the quote's "Asking: N"),
  and not goods whose text says no warranty (as oneshot.text_price): both arms note it in "seen" with the offer code would
  make; arm B makes that offer (oneshot.code_turn at STEP, 0.90 of the ask whatever the ladder's steps, never over my
  limit). Every later turn is as before in both arms. "applied" is that decision, not what was sent or paid: the kit log
  has the send, the ledger the payment (GPT Pro mw9tn6kj code review M);
- the assignment (order, arm, started_at) and every seen turn (live, applied) go to JOURNAL as they happen, before any
  send, so an order that never writes its orders.jsonl row is still in the ITT list (GPT Pro mw9tn6kj code review I);
- arm B acts only while the switch still says the same window: turning it off (or another salt) stops arm B at the next
  turn of an order already running, not only for new orders;
- the switch file must be written before its start (mtime <= start): a window started in the past, or one edited after its
  start, is off (independent review 5445a75 M1); the mtime is recorded;
- an arm B talk the change priced (applied) is left out of what both arms learn, as every buyer A/B here: the trades'
  prices (priced, item_stats), recent_asks, buyer_shop_profile and buyer_rank_pg (independent review 5445a75 I1). An arm
  B order whose talk it did not touch is the legacy talk and stays in.
