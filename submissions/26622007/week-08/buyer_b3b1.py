"""B3 + B1, one bundle switched on for every order (owner 11/08, telegram 7883 "1 2순위 함께 적용", 7896 "1시간 해당
전략으로 온전히 바꾸고 모니터링"; review/W-20261108-1355-AX경쟁분석/visitor-behavior.md section 4).

B3: after my one oneshot offer, a shop counter over 0.92 of its first ask is not taken; one more offer at 0.92 of the first
ask (never over my limit, the counter, nor at/under my last offer) goes instead, and the shop's next counter is taken by
oneshot as before. The buyers who beat us on saved held 3-4 rounds and got 3.7-12% off our shop; our buyer's final ask
was a median 0.952 of the first.
B1: the shops quoted after the chosen one rank by (food quote yield, or the default) x the shop's recent paid share
(.market/payments.jsonl joined to measure/orders.jsonl on the order, 6 h, shrunk to the overall share), so a shop whose
deals the kit could not pay goes later. The one slot for a shop that has not fitted stays.

Switch: .market/buyer_b3b1.json {"enabled": true}; missing, unreadable or anything else is off. BUYER_B3B1=0 in the
environment is off too. Read at every order (a buyer run is one order), so no restart either way.
