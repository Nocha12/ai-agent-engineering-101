"""A supply window's second restock run hands the kit the lines the first run already planned, without reading the
ledger again (W-20261110-1346-AXFable검토, 메인 지시 2, 11/10 16:2x: "공급 창당 호출을 goods에 더 쓰기").

/rules (Round 3 rulebook, Supply): "Restock windows: 3 minutes in every 20-minute slot, starting 0 to 5 minutes in.
Up to 20 units per call, one call per 10 seconds." So a window has room for about 18 calls. The kit
(scripts/market_kit.py, read-only) decides how they are spent: sync_loop looks every SYNC_EVERY (10 s) and starts the
restock command at most once per RESTOCK_EVERY (60 s) and never while the last run's supply thread is alive (:913-918);
restock() waits for the command to exit, reads its last JSON line and sends the first 10 lines one after another (:955),
sleeping the market's "wait" after each 429 (:960-961), about 11.6 s a line. Nothing here changes that pace or sends a
call the rules do not allow; only how soon the second run of a window answers.

What the kit log shows (11/10 14:44-16:24, 6 windows): the first run printed 9 lines, never 10 (the held next_window
SKU G1465c678 was planned in the first ten and dropped after the cut, restock.main "if hold and not trial"); they went
out in 93-111 s; the second run began 10-16 s after the last of them (the kit's 10 s look), took 12-19 s to print
(8-12 s to the demand model: the ledger sync and the 296 MB rows file read beside the buyer; 4-7 s more), and its
first line went out 8 s after that (measure.tick's 45 MB seller memory and the rows file once more, then the exit of a
process holding 1.37M rows). 36-40 s of an open window without a call, 12-15 lines a window (13.4 on 11/10 PM); it was
16.4 on 11/07-11/08 when the rows file was half the size. The goods of 100k+ in a call fell 2.44 -> 1.35-2.03 units
over the same days (restock_fresh_slots). Net per call over the calls of 11/09 00:00-11/10 04:00 (unit cost and price
from .market/measure, refunds from the ledger): goods of 1M+ 49.9k, 100k-1M 19.2k, food 15.8k (31% of the calls, 19% of
the net), so a call more is worth 15-50k and the food lines are not what to cut: an empty food SKU is 31 of the last
32 "not in stock" refusals.

Arm B, by window (sha256("window-fast|salt|opens_at"), the first four bytes under treat):
- the run that sends a window's first lines plans without the held next_window SKUs, so they take no place among the
  ten, and leaves the plan's next lines (CARRY_LINES, the same plan() and guard, the lines sent and the held SKUs left
  out) in .market/restock_carry.json when the agent's queue is empty;
- the next run, while that window is open, takes them once (restock.window_fast): the ledger sync as always, then the
  cash buffer from the ledger's tail exactly as main() computes it, the lines sent in the last PENDING_SECONDS counted
  in full as still on their way (never fewer than pending() counts: every unit and cash cap is at least as tight),
  restock.guard over today's inventory.json, late_lines, hard_limits.final_buy, note_sent. No demand model, loss
  watch, price log, agent, forum or tool run: the run after it does them, as every run does now. Anything missing,
  stale, unreadable, another window's, a next_window plan that is not done, an opening phase, or no line left: the
  usual run, as if this module were not there.
Arm A and off: today's run exactly.

Switch: .market/restock_window_fast.json {"enabled": true, "study": "<id>", "salt": "<salt>", "treat": 0.7,
"start_at": <epoch>, "stop_at": <epoch>}; on only in [start_at, stop_at), a window of at most MAX_WINDOW_HOURS.
Missing, unreadable, a bad value or time, or anything else is off. RESTOCK_WINDOW_FAST=0 in the environment is off too.
Write it with switch_on(). Read at every restock run: no restart either way, and it stops by itself at stop_at.
Never raises.
