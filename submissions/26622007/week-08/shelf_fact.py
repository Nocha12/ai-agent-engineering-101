"""Default-off A/B S-shelf (11/10): the exact food shelf-life question answered with the quoted unit's real remaining
hours instead of the harness.

11/09 23:53 - 11/10 01:48 market-kit.log: 56 seller turns were exactly shelf_life_reply.QUESTION. For the 54 whose unit
is known (shelf_jev_skip events.jsonl), units_in expires_at left at least the hours asked every time; still the harness
answered "I can't confirm the remaining shelf life" (or "unable to verify", "not sure") in 27 of 56. Talks with that
answer were canceled 13 of 27, with another answer 7 of 29 (Fisher p .094, observational: price and "final" wording are
mixed in). review/W-20261109-2040-AX셀러전략/report.md §10-4.

Treatment (arm B): shelf_life_reply.factual_answer's line ("This unit has X hours of shelf life remaining at this
quote. My price: <ask>."), a counter at the current ask; no Jev and no harness for that turn. It answers only when the
unit is food, known, has a finite expiry and its remaining life (rounded down) is at least the hours asked; otherwise
both arms take the original path. Arm A: the original path, unchanged. Every price guard after the turn is unchanged.

Randomization unit: the task, by sha256(salt|study|version|task) against share; the arm is fixed at the first eligible
turn and journaled (event "turn") before a B answer is given, so the analysis is ITT over tasks that reached an eligible
turn; a failed write keeps the original path. Outcome rows (seller.remember: deal, unpaid, canceled, ...) for every
assigned task.

R1 (shelf_jev_skip) protection: while R1 runs as a trial (mode "ab", active) this module never answers and never assigns
or writes a turn row, so the two treatments are never on together (R1's B leaves Jev out of the same turn that S-shelf B
would answer by code; with both on, R1's contrast would exist only inside S-shelf A). A talk assigned before R1 came
on still gets its outcome rows (ITT), and R1's rows carry the talk's S-shelf assignment (shelf_jev_skip.OTHER_TRIALS).
R1 kept as policy (mode "adopted") has no arms to spoil: it is arm A's baseline, S-shelf runs on top of it, and every
turn row says which R1 it ran over (r1_mode: "adopted" or None).
seller.py hands both the same clock for the turn. Talks enrolled in the old shelf_life trial (SHELF_REPLY, an id on
deal["shelf_life"]) are left alone so its control arm is never answered by this one.

Window: start_at < stop_at and stop_at - start_at <= 20 h; outside it, or absent/invalid/disabled configuration: the
original path. Talks assigned earlier keep their arm for later eligible turns only inside the window, and still get
outcome rows. Switch: MARKET_DIR/shelf_fact/config.json (SHELF_FACT_CONFIG overrides), the shelf_jev_skip format
{study, salt, version, epoch, enabled, mode "ab", share, start_at, stop_at}; mode "adopted" answers every eligible turn.
