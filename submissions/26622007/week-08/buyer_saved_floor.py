"""The limit keeps my current Saved, not the fixed 0.30 (W-20261109-1638-AXPro주기, review/W-20261109-1638-AXPro주기).

Saved is the sum over deals of surplus / list, divided by deals + 100 (agent.md 228). A deal that keeps r of its list
moves Saved by (r - S) / (deals + 101): it lowers Saved whenever r < S, my Saved now. market_buyer.saved_cap kept a
fixed SAVED_MIN_SHARE of 0.30 and the accept band (plan A) takes up to 105% of that limit, so deals at 0.69-0.73 of
list were bought while S was 0.3096: 361 of my 1,841 deals in the 24 h to 11/09 16:41 kept r < S (goods 216, food 145),
and leaving the 288 whose price alone was over (1 - S) of list would have put Saved at .3105 instead of .3096
(ana/saved_floor.py), where ddolcom .3097 and 25512088 .3099 sit just above (one place = .0089 of buyer ALL).
The short-warranty path (buyer_short_warranty.p_max) already holds deals to S; this does the same for the 6 h path.

On, an order's share is max(SAVED_MIN_SHARE, S + margin), at most MAX_SHARE, S the board's (board_history.jsonl,
not older than buyer_short_warranty.BOARD_MAX_AGE); with band "cap" (the default) the accept band is not used, so
nothing over the limit is taken. A board that cannot be read leaves the order as before.

Switch: .market/buyer_saved_floor.json {"enabled": true, "floor": true|false, "margin": 0.0, "band": "cap"|"keep",
"ab": {"salt": "...", "share": 0.5}, "kinds": ["food", "goods"], "start_at": <epoch>, "stop_at": <epoch>}; on only in
[start_at, stop_at), a window of at most MAX_WINDOW_HOURS: the study ends at stop_at by this code, not by the
experiments registry or a reminder (W-20261109-1638 지시 3). Missing, unreadable or anything else (no window, a time that
is not a finite number, reversed, too long) is off, and off is the old behaviour exactly. switch_on writes it.
Arm B's rows stay out of the learning after stop_at too (they were bought without the band). The arm is set once
per buyer run at its clock: a run resumed after stop_at is off, so the judgement counts an order by its first
assignment, sha1(salt|order) over every order in the window (review M-4). With "ab", only the orders whose sha1(salt|order) falls under share are arm B (the floor); arm A is the
old behaviour and is still returned so the judgement can count both. BUYER_SAVED_FLOOR=0 in the environment is off
too. "floor": false keeps SAVED_MIN_SHARE and only turns the band off (GPT Pro 1638 §2.4: the first A/B). Arm B's
trades and orders rows are left out of the price, rank and shop-profile learning both arms read. "kinds" (a list) limits it to those order kinds, so it can start on food when the food study ends and on goods
when the goods studies end; an order of another or unknown kind is off. Read at every order (a buyer run is one
order), so no restart either way. On, it moves what other buyer studies see (goods-grade's limit_a, quote fit, the
shop profile's band records, food talks without the band): start it on a kind only after that kind's studies end, and
every order it touched carries "saved_floor" in its measure record (review I3).

Each record names the study (the ab salt), VERSION, the board snapshot it read (board_ts) and the floor flag, and the
early exit with no shop in stock writes it too, so the judgement recounts both arms by sha1(salt|order) over every order
(GPT Pro 1638 P2). With the floor on (arm B, "floor" true), a receipt for another SKU than the one asked is held to
that SKU's break chance, not b = 0 (recheck; market_buyer.receipt_chance). The band-only first A/B ("floor": false)
keeps b = 0 there, so arm B differs from arm A by the band alone.
