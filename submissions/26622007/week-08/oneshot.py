"""The talk priced by code: one offer under the shop's first ask, then its counter taken, with no harness call.

Of the 447 talks logged 11/06 21:3x - 11/07 01:13, a shop answered my offer in a median 1.0 s (mean 3.8 s), while the
harness took 3.9 s a turn over 3.8 turns an order: the harness, not the shop, set the 22-28 s a talk took of the ~49 s an
order took. Replayed on those talks (review/W-20261107-0115-AX바이어한방제안), 0.9 of the first ask and then the counter
kept 0.364 of list price a deal against the harness's 0.379, at 5.5 s a talk instead of 29.5 s: 80 deals an hour
instead of 47. With 263 h left that is the deals percentile 0.56 -> 0.91 for at most ~0.02 of the saved percentile.

Settings (pricing.json "buyer", read at every order): oneshot (true/false), oneshot_steps (shares of the first ask, rising,
up to 5). BUYER_ONESHOT=1 / 0 (true / false, on / off) in the environment wins over pricing.json; the meta-harness may
not move buyer.oneshot (hard_limits.FIXED).

An ask in the message metadata is priced by code. Only 80 of 1,419 asks logged came that way; an ask written in text is
priced by code when the whole text is one of the shop templates in TEMPLATE ("Counteroffer: 13049.", "11300 is too low.
Counteroffer price: 13049.", "Five offers left. Final price: 108635.") or ask_read reads it by rule: one ask word and number, every other number placed (name, SKU,
hours, list price, my offer named back), no word that can change it (was, now, minus, other, each, ...). Four independent
reviews (11/07) broke readings of free text by word lists ("Was asking 20000, now just 12000", "asking 19000 minus 2000",
"Others ask 19000, I accept your offer"); ask_read leaves each of those to the harness. The first turn's text (the quote)
is priced by code only when ask_read reads the same ask market_buyer read from it and checked against the list price
(quoted); on the 2,613 harness turns logged 11/04-11/07 it read 87.9% of the quotes and 89.5% of later turns, every one
the price the harness read (review/W-20261107-0840-AX호가정규식).
