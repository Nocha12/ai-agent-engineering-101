"""A goods quote that names a 6 h or longer warranty is priced as one, not at the shop's 0 h history (B-W1,
W-20261109-1925-AXPro주기; review/W-20261109-1755-AXPro주기/buyer-candidates.md).

With buyer_short_warranty on, hours_for takes the least of what the quote said and the shop's history
(market_buyer.short_warranty_shops: the last goods receipt short is enough, taken as 0 h). warranty_hours_said reads a
quote that names 72 h as None ("leaves 6 h open"), so the history alone is left and a quote saying "grade A, market
certificate attached, 72 h warranty" was priced at p_max(0 h): 434 quotes in 426 orders in the 24 h to 11/09 19:30
asked at or under the 6 h cap (105% band) and were left over the 0 h one, 301 of those orders bought nothing
(ana/bw1_counterfactual.py). The same shops' goods sales in the ledger those 24 h: thisjonghoon 72 h 234, 6 h 127, none
55; yms979 72 h 2,967, none 222; to me only 72 h and 6 h. (The 434 is from the 120-character quote text orders.jsonl
keeps; the flag itself is read from the whole quote text. Analysis scripts: review/W-20261109-1925-AXPro주기/ana/.)

Arm B: a quote whose text names only warranties of 6 h or more, and no "no warranty"/0 h/shorter one, is priced as a
6 h deal (hours_for None) whatever the history. Read conservatively: a sentence that names the warranty with a negation
or an option ("No 72 h warranty", "optional 72 h warranty", "available for +12%", "void", "보증 미적용") or a 0 h
anywhere in the whole text leaves the quote as now (independent review 08b282d I1). The receipt check is not touched: a receipt under 6 h still goes to
market_buyer.warranty_short and buyer_short_warranty.receipt_check at its own hours, so a shop that says 72 h and ships
0 h is paid only under p_max(0 h), as now. Arm A, off and every other quote: as before.

Switch: .market/buyer_warranty_said.json {"enabled": true, "study": "...", "salt": "...", "share": 0.5,
"start_at": <epoch>, "stop_at": <epoch>}; on only in [start_at, stop_at), a window of at most MAX_WINDOW_HOURS; missing,
unreadable, a bad field or outside the window is off, and off is the old behaviour exactly. BUYER_WARRANTY_SAID=0 in the
environment is off too. Read once per order (a buyer run is one order), so no restart either way. Arms by
sha1(salt|order) < share, a hash axis of its own (not saved-floor's or goods-grade's salt).

On, it moves what other goods studies see: buyer_goods_grade.adjust runs only when hours_for is None, and the chosen
shop changes. So it is off while buyer_goods_grade is on (state), and starts after the goods studies end.

Kept apart from arm A (review 08b282d I2, as buyer_saved_floor): an arm B orders row (said_b) is not learned by
recent_asks, buyer_rank_pg or buyer_shop_profile, and an arm B trade inside its window is not read by
short_warranty_shops, so arm B's deals and its 0 h receipts change neither arm's 0 h history (each arm sees arm A's);
after stop_at the trade counts again as any other. Measure (I3): every goods order with the switch on carries
"warranty_said" (both arms): the hash arm ("assigned") and the arm used ("arm"), the shops a quote would change
("eligible", a post-quote variable: arm B may close the quote wait sooner), the chosen shop, "applied", "refused"
(the receipt fell short) and "cap0" (market_buyer.short_cap of the chosen shop as arm A would have it). The verdict is
ITT over every goods order of the window, by assigned arm, not over "eligible" orders.

Stop (I4): arm B buys at the 6 h price from shops that ship 0 h on some receipts (thisjonghoon 55 of 416, yms979 222
of 3,189 goods sales in the ledger); the receipt check refuses those as now, but more often. Each applied arm B order
that got a receipt appends one line to EVENTS (with the window's start_at, so a reused study name never counts old
lines); when TRIP_MIN or more of those receipts were refused and the refused share is over TRIP_SHARE, every later
order of the window goes to arm A ("tripped" in its row and the log): the old behaviour, recorded, not silent. Orders
already running when it trips finish in arm B, so the stop can come a few receipts late.

Read conservatively on purpose: a duration under 6 h anywhere in the text ("Delivered in 2 h", "Reply within 5 min")
also leaves the quote as now; in the 24 h to 11/09 20:05 that took no quote the old reading set aside (the 70 that
flipped were stored text cut at "if it", read whole they are set aside; ana/bw1_said_replay.py).
Undo: delete the switch (or BUYER_WARRANTY_SAID=0). Arm B trades already made stay out of short_warranty_shops until
their stop_at (at most MAX_WINDOW_HOURS), as they would have in the window.
