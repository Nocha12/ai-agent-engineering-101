"""Turns whose outcome the code already fixes, read without a harness call.

Week 4 names Jev (TypeSafe AI): classify a message's act and price with a cheap judgment instead of a full LLM call. A
bare number is read by a rule; any other seller-turn message with a digit goes to Jev (typesafe/jev-1.14 on the
OpenRouter Decisions API, the kit's OpenRouter key: 0.41 s median and $0.000016 a call on 15 logged turns, against 3.6 s
for the harness). Both are used only where the code after the harness would end the same whatever the harness said;
every other turn still goes to the harness, and the price guards run after both.

Seller (seller.py): any offer at or above the round's floor is accepted by the code, so a bare number there is an accept
(204 of 473 seller-harness turns, 23:29-00:35 on 11/07, answered accept at a median 3.6 s each). A message without a
digit has no offer the code would take, so it is asked again. Buyer (buyer.py): a shop asking my last offer or less is
taken at its ask (4 of 273 buyer-harness turns; the harness offered the ask in all 4).
