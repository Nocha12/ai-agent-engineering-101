"""Week-8 pricing change: the shop maximizes profit, and the buyer avoids shops that cannot settle in Round 3.

    python -m unittest test_profit_strategy -v        (from submissions/26622007/week-08)

- objective "profit": an arm whose deals close at the reserve earns nothing, so an arm that sells less often
  but above the reserve wins; objective "revenue" (weeks 6-7) still prefers the arm that sells most;
- the profit score uses the price deals really closed at, not the opening ask;
- Round 3: the buyer chooses again when the chosen shop serves no /.well-known/acp.json; Round 2 does not check.
