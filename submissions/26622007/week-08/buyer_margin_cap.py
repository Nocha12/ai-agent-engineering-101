"""The limit and the pick read the unit's grade: Saved is the share of the shop's margin kept (Patch 3.6, 11/12).

Patch 3.6 scores a deal (list - price) / (list - cost), cost the shop's for that unit: 1 at or under cost, 0 for a
break the warranty refunded, -1 for one it did not, and Saved is the sum over deals / (deals + 100), over all of
round 3. The cost is drawn by grade, A 55-75%, B 40-60%, C 25-45% of list, so the same share of list kept is a
different score by grade: at 60% of list a grade A unit keeps all of the margin, a B unit .80, a C unit .62.
market_buyer.saved_cap holds every deal to one share of list (0.32) and best_quote ranks by the share of list kept,
which reads a cheap grade C ask as the best deal. Checked against the board with the public ledger (settles with the
grade, supply batches for the cost): 61 buyers' Saved to a mean error of .032, ours .7309 against the board's .7264
(review/W-20261114-0810-AX가게선별/result.md). Our 24 h to 11/14 08:00 by segment: food A .97, goods A .90, food B
.86, food C .74, goods B .70 (11% refunded), goods C .49 (26% refunded), against our Saved .726; a deal moves Saved by
(score - Saved) / (deals + 101), so the last two lower it at any price we were paying.

expected(p, grade, b) is the score a price p of list is expected to keep, (1 - b) min(1, (1 - p) / (1 - MID[grade])),
with the cost at its grade's middle; cap() is the price that keeps cfg["target"] of it, list (1 - target (1 - MID) /
(1 - b)), and 0 when the grade cannot reach the target even at cost (goods grade C: 70% survive). The grade is the
one the quote names (buyer_goods_grade.grade: the named grade was the settled one in 2,194 of 2,195 of our deals to
11/14); a quote that names none keeps today's limit and is ranked as grade B. Goods take the grade's chance of
breaking (market_model.unit_break_chance, never under the SKU's), food none.

Only ever lowers the limit (market_buyer takes the min with value_limit and saved_cap), so the budget, the hard
limits, the warranty rules and the cash checks stay where they are; a lower limit can only mean fewer or cheaper deals.

Switch: .market/buyer_margin_cap.json {"enabled": true, "target": 0.75}. Missing, unreadable or anything else is off,
and off is the limit and the pick as before. BUYER_MARGIN_CAP=0 in the environment is off too. Read at every order (a
buyer run is one order), so no restart either way. A talk whose limit the cap lowered (lowered()) has no accept band
and stays out of buyer_shop_profile, so the lower limits do not widen the band of the talks the cap leaves alone.
