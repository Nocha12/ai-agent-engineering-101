"""Default-off A/B W-fact (11/10): the exact goods warranty question answered with the warranty the shop already put on
this talk, instead of the harness.

11/10 06:20-07:00 market-kit.log: a buyer asks "Does this unit come with a warranty of at least 6 hours written on the
receipt? I only buy goods with one. ..." after our first quote. That quote already said "This unit comes with a 72 h
warranty" (Seller.warranty_terms, logged WARRANTY 72 h) and the receipt carries it (stock_receipt warranty_hours). The
question has no offer in it, so the turn goes to the harness, whose text is then dropped: the buyer reads only "Please
tell me the price you offer. My price: <ask>." The question is never answered (the harness itself, with no warranty in
decide_turn's prompt, wrote "I can't confirm that warranty" or "I can only offer this unit" in 13 of 14). All 14 talks
were canceled. review/W-20261109-2040-AX셀러전략/report.md §10-9.

Treatment (arm B): "Yes. This unit comes with a <h> h warranty written on the signed receipt: if it breaks within <h> h,
you get the full price back. My price: <ask>.", a counter at the current ask; no Jev and no harness for that turn. It
answers only for goods whose talk carries a warranty (deal["warranty"], set by warranty_terms) of at least the hours
asked; a talk sold as is (seller_warranty_trial treatment) or with less is left alone in both arms. Arm A: the original
path, unchanged. Every price guard after the turn is unchanged. The question is goods only; S-shelf (shelf_fact) answers
food only, so no turn is in both.

Randomization unit: the task, by sha256(salt|study|version|task) against share; the arm is fixed at the first eligible
turn and journaled (event "turn") before a B answer is given (ITT over tasks that reached an eligible turn); a failed
write keeps the original path. Outcome rows (seller.remember: deal, unpaid, canceled, ...) for every assigned task.

Window: start_at < stop_at and stop_at - start_at <= 20 h; outside it, or absent/invalid/disabled configuration: the
original path. The switch (WARRANTY_FACT_CONFIG overrides) has the shelf_jev_skip format
{study, salt, version, epoch, enabled, mode "ab", share, start_at, stop_at}; mode "adopted" answers every eligible turn.
Switch: .market/warranty_fact/config.json
