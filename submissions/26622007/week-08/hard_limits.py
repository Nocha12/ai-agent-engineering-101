#   bucket (p90 10.0%); the most refunded in 1 h 2.76M, in 6 h 5.65M, in 24 h 14.58M. A unit breaks within 6 h of the
#   sale, spread evenly (2,098 market breaks 11/06: median 2.9 h, p90 5.4 h), so a sale a hours old still owes
#   rate x price x (6 - a) / 6.
# - storage: 1% of the stock's cost a day (agent.md).
# - the worst 24 h fall of book was 2.5M (11/04 14:45), mostly these same refunds; cash fell 90.7M in 24 h only because
