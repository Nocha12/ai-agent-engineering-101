"""Round 3 prices from the GPT Pro profit review (review/W-20261103-2120/gpt-pro-answer1.md §2-b, §2-c):

- floor F = ceil((C + H + max(1,000, 0.03 L)) / (1 - b)): the unit's cost C, H = 0.0025 C for six hours of storage, a
  minimum profit, and b the chance a goods unit breaks under the 6 h warranty (food 0; goods 0.15, or the ledger's
  rate when it is higher). F is the reserve: no normal sale goes under it.
- first ask P0 = max(F, min(L, 1.05 M)), M the median the ledger shows for this SKU (or the kind's share of list price
  when the SKU has too few deals); a price this shop was already paid for the SKU stays a candidate. For SKUs in
  price.scarce_asks (units sold out within minutes of each supply window) that fixed ask is a candidate as well.
  price.ask_caps then caps P0 per SKU and grade for slow stock, never below F.
- goods whose break chance is above warranty.max_break (pricing.json, 0.5 from 11/06) are not sold at all: no sale without
  the warranty.
- each unit is also checked at b = max(0.25, its own b) (stress) and the log says when the first ask would lose money there.
pricing.json "price" holds the numbers.
