"""Quotes ranked by the chance of a deal times the share of list it keeps (÷ seconds only with "per_time": true; owner 11/08, telegram 7959-7963,
7977; review/W-20261108-1655-AX가게별바이어/shop-profiles.md 5-6: replayed on 11/07 19:09 - 11/08 19:09, P x price took
+3% deals and +11-14% buyer ALL/h over the current order, ÷T within 1% of it).

Of the quotes within my limit (fits first, as before; the limits and guards are not touched here), best_quote keeps the
one with the most

    P(shop, kind) x g / T,   g = (1 - b)(1 - E[final] / list),   E[final] = ask x E[final / first ask](shop, kind)

(g = (1 - b)(1 - p) - q at a short warranty, buyer_short_warranty.expected), T = the quote seconds so far + the shop's
expected talk seconds + NEXT_ORDER_SECONDS. The share is of the final price against the list price (7961), never the cut
from the ask. P, E[final / first ask] and the talk seconds come from the last HOURS of measure/orders.jsonl, per shop and
kind, shrunk to the kind's pool: (k + SHRINK p) / (n + SHRINK). No talk seconds known: no ÷T.

The ÷T is only with "per_time": true in the switch; without it the key is P x g (main 11/08 19:22: the final replay,
shop-profiles.md 6, gave P x price +12% ALL/h and ÷T +9%).

No-fit learning uses the recorded selection tier and eligibility, not any-fit over all quotes. Legacy tier
unknowns are excluded and counted. Learning successes require an exact confirmed payment/settlement join;
delivered unknowns are excluded from resolved probability denominators and retain unknown economic value.
No-fit requires the versioned A/B switch documented in rank-integrity.md; old nofit switches are off.
A and B share adaptive statistics, so A is not a fixed holdout and this is not a full-ON causal estimate.

Switch: .market/buyer_rank_pg.json {"enabled": true}; missing, unreadable or anything else is off, and off is the
current order exactly. BUYER_RANK_PG=0 in the environment is off too. Read at every order, so no restart either way.

"ledger_cover": true in the switch (exactly true) reads the ledger back to the oldest paid seq of the order window
(LEDGER_MAX_BYTES at most) instead of the fixed TAIL_BYTES tail. Every order and both arms of any study read the same
stats, so turning it on is a time boundary common to all of them: turn it on at a recorded time and write that time
in the running studies' records. The cache is computed again at once when its ledger_cover differs from the switch,
and the order rows and journal carry "ledger_cover": true while the stats they used were so computed.
