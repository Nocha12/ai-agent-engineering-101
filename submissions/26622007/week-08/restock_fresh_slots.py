"""Listed goods: a SKU's unit target counts the units that still sell at the market's price, not the ones that waited
(W-20261110-1346-AXFable검토; 대표님 11/10 13:46 "fable 5.2로도 검토해보고 코드 수정해서 배포해봐", 11/06 19:03
"복리를 진짜 제대로 활용해야해").

Why the cash did not go back into stock (review/W-20261110-1346-AXFable검토/report.md, kit files and ledger to 11/10
14:2x): 190.9M of cash against a 20.9M buffer, and no line was ever cut for cash. A unit's cost is drawn on arrival
(/rules: A 55-75% of list) and its reserve is its own break-even, so a dear draw (cost .70-.75, floor .74-.78) sits over
what buyers pay (.66-.71) and waits, while a cheap draw sells within the hour: of the goods of 100k+ supplied 11/09
18:00 - 11/10 08:00, grade A units costing under .65 of list sold 78-83% within 1 h and 96-97% within 6 h, those at
.70-.75 23% and 49% (28% still held). restock.fill_listed and guard count every unit held against sku_target_units, so
the waiting units fill the SKU's slots and nothing is asked (no guard line is printed when held >= target: the
14:0x count of guard lines could not see it). At 14:2x 97 of the 147 goods units held had waited over 3 h with a floor
over the SKU x grade median, in 173 slots (G8ec51935 10 of 12, G1515d951 11 of 12, G24f5f979 6 of 8, Gb5d0dde7 5 of 6).
The goods bought fell with it and the sales with them, since the shop sells what it buys: 1,970 units of 100k+ on 11/07,
1,625 a day 11/08 - 11/09 12:00, 1,010 a day 11/09 18:00 - 11/10 08:00, the cheap draws selling as fast as before.

Arm B: for a listed goods SKU with a target T, a unit held under `hours` (2) counts; of the older ones the first
floor(aged_units x T) (1.0) do not, the rest do; and a line may take at most `step` (3) units more than the old count
allowed, so a SKU fills again over a few supply windows and never holds more than T + floor(aged_units x T) units.
A waiting unit stays in stock at its cost (Book counts it at cost, /rules; storage 1% of cost a day) and sells when a
buyer pays its floor; nothing is sold cheaper for this. Not while the SKU is in a surge over MAX_SURGE (the units
would be dear ones), not food, not a SKU without a target or off the proven / priority lists. Only the target reads
this count: max_units_per_sku and the high-price and surge caps still count every unit held (so a target of 12 holds
at most 20), and the cash buffer, stock cost and break guards apply to the lines as before. A SKU that already holds
its target and is asked again only for this goes after every other line of the run, listed or not, the agent's and
the small food top-ups too (restock.fresh_extra in plan, urgent_listed and main), so today's lines keep their places
in a window's ~14-18 supply calls; a SKU under its target keeps its place and asks a larger line (independent reviews
8023a19 I1-I3, 798955a I4). Arm A counts as today.
Arms by SKU, sha256("fresh-slots|salt|sku"): the first four bytes under treat (0.7 by default, 0.3-1.0) is B, an axis
of its own (goods-margin hashes SKU x grade under its own salt).

Switch: .market/restock_fresh_slots.json {"enabled": true, "study": "<id>", "salt": "<salt>", "hours": 2,
"aged_units": 1.0, "step": 3, "treat": 0.7, "start_at": <epoch>, "stop_at": <epoch>}; on only in [start_at, stop_at),
a window of at most MAX_WINDOW_HOURS. Missing, unreadable, a bad value or time, or anything else is off, and off is
today's count exactly. RESTOCK_FRESH_SLOTS=0 in the environment is off too. Write it with switch_on(). Read at every
restock run (a new process each time): no restart either way, and the treatment stops by itself at stop_at. Never
raises. A new salt or treat needs a new study id.
