"""Default-off A/B G-read (11/10): the outside buyer's grade-preference opening read with its B.

11/10 06:20-07:58 market-kit.log: 31 talks open with "I want to buy <name> (<SKU>). I prefer grade C (refurbished) or B
(damaged box) with a warranty of at least 6 hours on the receipt, priced for its grade; grade A only if you have nothing
else. Please quote your cheapest unit that way." shop_stock.needs reads that as grades {A, C}: GRADES takes "grade C"
and "grade A", and the "or B (damaged box)" after the parenthesis is lost. So shop_stock.pick never offers a free
grade B unit there, even the one with the lowest floor: G8ec51935's B unit (u-7d82c4d0860b, floor 1509825, in stock from
06:42) was passed over three times for A units (floor 1706590); in two of them the buyer offered 1546976 and 1639776,
above the B floor, below the A one, and canceled. review/W-20261109-2040-AX셀러전략/report.md §10-10.

Treatment (arm B): for that exact sentence only, pick also allows grade B (shop_stock.pick add_grades), so the unit
with the lowest floor among A, B and C is offered, as for any buyer who names its grades. Quote, floor, warranty and every
guard after the pick are unchanged; the B unit is priced as a B (profit_price grade_break). Arm A: the original path.

Eligible: only the opening as the outside buyer writes it, 33 of 33 in market-kit.log(.1) 11/10 08:49-13:41:
"I want to buy <name> (<SKU>). <the sentence> Please quote your cheapest unit that way." Any other text, a grade word in
the name, or anything before or after it (e.g. "No damaged box units") keeps the original path (independent review
889d594 M3).

Randomization unit: the task, by sha256(salt|study|version|task) against share, journaled (event "assigned") before the
pick, so every eligible opening is in the ITT list whatever is in stock; a failed write keeps the original path.
"selected" records the unit picked and, in both arms, the unit each arm's pick gives (unit_a/unit_b, switch): only a
talk with switch true can differ between the arms; both picks read one units() snapshot. "no_quote" (reason selection,
warranty, unit_unavailable) ends a talk before a quote (M1); "outcome" rows carry seller.remember's result (agreed,
deal, unpaid, canceled, rejected, ...; a task can have several, the last one counts) and quoted (the quote went out:
seller sets deal["grade_read_quoted"] right after it), so a buyer's rejection after a quote is never read as a talk with
no quote, and an outcome with quoted false (an error between self.open and the quote) is no quote. An assigned task with
neither (an error after the pick) is an unknown outcome, never a loss or a non-sale. Rows carry the
other trials' arms (others) for the cross tables; payment and refunds are joined from the ledger by task and unit.
Window: [start_at, stop_at) with stop_at - start_at <= 12 h (make_config writes 9-12 h), else the original path; NaN,
inf, bool, a huge int, a missing field, a start in the future and the stop itself are off. Switch (GRADE_READ_CONFIG
overrides): {study, salt, version, epoch, enabled, mode "ab"|"adopted", share, start_at, stop_at}.
Overlap: a talk moved to a B unit leaves the grade A only trials (floor_margin, a_open) and enters goods_margin's SKU x
grade B cell; for furniture it would enter a grade-break trial (GBT) unit: none is on after 11/10 13:00, and a new GBT
window inside this one is analysed together (rows carry the unit and its grade). The pick ranks by today's floor, before
any of those trials moves a price, so which unit is quoted never depends on their arms; while a GBT window is open
(price.grade_break_trial, or a setting that cannot be read) every opening keeps the original path and gets no row, since
floor_rank does not see the GBT b (independent review 8a694a5 M).
