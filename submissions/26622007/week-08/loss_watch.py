"""Round 3: where the shop's money goes besides stock it bought, one "[loss]" line each in the kit's log.

The kit logs a "[broken]" line only for what my buyer bought. Nothing tells the shop that a unit it sold broke, that a food
unit lost a grade or expired, or what storage costs, so the restock hook (every 60 s; its stderr reaches
logs/market-kit.log as "[buyer] ...") runs check() and prints:

    [loss] break_refund <name> <amount> ...          a unit I sold broke within the warranty I gave: the price comes back off
    [loss] break_no_warranty <name> 0 ...            it broke outside any warranty: no refund, but the buyer's surplus is 0
    [loss] break_unknown_warranty <name> <price> ... it broke and neither the ledger nor my records say the warranty
    [loss] expired <name> <cost> ...                 a food unit passed its date in stock: its cost is gone
    [loss] grade_drop <name> 0 A->B ...              a food unit fell a grade while waiting (no money yet, a cheaper sale later)
    [loss] storage <n> goods units <amount>          storage for the last hour(s), at inventory.json's storage_per_day
    [loss] checkout_refused_warranty <sku> 0 ...     my buyer's kit would not pay: the shop's warranty was too short

Sources, all of them the market's own: inventory.json, the Round 3 ledger rows market_model keeps (kinds settle and
broken), and the kit's own "[acp] settled ... ledger #N" lines, which say which settles were mine. A refund kind in the
ledger is not documented, so none is assumed. Each loss also goes to memory/agent/losses.jsonl and the daily note, and the
running totals to .market/loss_state.json, which the scorecard reads. Profit itself is the balance (refunds and storage
come off it at the market); this file says where it went. Nothing here can stop a restock.
