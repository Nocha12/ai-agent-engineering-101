"""The market buyer: picks a shop from the market's list, trades with it over A2A, remembers it.

    python market_buyer.py --shops .market/shops.json --item lamp --budget 120 --order .market/order.json

What the code does and what the harness does:
- Code reads {shops} (name, card URL, newest-first reviews) and my memory file, and turns
  both into a short summary per shop: review count, average stars, the newest few reviews,
  and my own trades with that shop.
- Code drops shops my memory has caught cheating (a receipt that did not match the deal)
  and shops that did not answer my last two visits. A shop is remembered by name,
  because its URL changes every time its kit restarts.
- Code skips shops with two or more reviews averaging under BAD_STARS.
- The buyer opens new markets: EXPLORE_NEW of the time (always, when it knows no cheap shop yet)
  the pool is shops with at most LOW_REVIEWS reviews it has never tried; otherwise the pool is
  shops that sold this item to it under its own average price before ("found cheap").
- The market and the market test write different memory files, chosen from the {shops} path.
- The harness picks one of the remaining shops and says why (strict JSON schema).
- The negotiation is the week-06 buyer (buyer.negotiate): code guards the budget.
- Code checks the receipt against the deal (price we agreed, item, A2A task id),
  writes the trade to memory, and writes the stars and review from those facts.
- The last output line is the result JSON the kit sends to the market.
- From Round 3 only settled deals count, and the kit can pay only a shop that serves /.well-known/acp.json.
  Code checks the chosen shop for it and chooses again without that shop (up to ACP_TRIES times).
- Round 3 orders name a category and its acceptable SKUs ({order}). Code keeps only shops that have one
  that fits (offers), asks for the SKU worth the most within the budget, never pays over its list price (a
  buyer's value), and tells the kit to pay only for food that will last (accept). Memory is by SKU there.
  A receipt that does not hold up is not passed to the kit, because the kit would pay it.
  The shop is chosen by a Luna agent that may look things up through the tools (agent_loop.py) and cites what it used;
  the old single question remains as the fallback. Goods are worth less by how often that SKU breaks in the ledger.
  What broke after I bought it is linked back to the shop (broken.jsonl + settled.jsonl) and shows in my history of it.
  Round 3 has its own memory file: lamps and chairs say nothing about it, and shops I only met then count as untried.
  Only one thing carries over from the earlier file: shops caught cheating on a receipt.
