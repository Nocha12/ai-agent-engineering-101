"""Food: a shop whose last unit of this SKU the kit would not pay for, for too little shelf life, is not picked over a
shop that can be (review/W-20261109-0738-AXPro주기, GPT Pro mw8fgl7t §2·§7 buyer 1).

The kit pays for food only when the unit lasts use_within_hours + SHELF_MARGIN (market_buyer.accept_policy). A shop that
does not say how long its unit lasts gets through shelf_refused, wins on price, and the deal ends unpaid: 11/08 07:41 -
11/09 07:41, 43 food orders ended "not paying: X h of shelf life left, the policy asks for Y" (refused 61 of 1,728 passed
to the kit), 11 of them with another numeric ask at or under the price we agreed. yeonsong2/G3434758a, 11/09 07:12-07:41:
paid, then 499 h, 499 h, 238 h, 241 h left against 540.1 asked, four unpaid in a row.

The last payment line of a shop x SKU within HOURS says what that shop is handing out now: refused for shelf life with
L h left, the unit it sends next is taken to last L less the hours since; paid, nothing is known against it. In arm B a
quote whose shop x SKU is expected short of this order's need leaves the pick when another quote within my limit stays
(an ask over it may end with no talk at all, which is no better than an unpaid try); else nothing changes. Both arms
read the history and note would_drop, so the 9 h reading can compare the orders the change could touch; only B acts.
Arm A and the switch off pick as before. A shop B leaves out gets no new payment line from B, so its evidence renews
from arm A's deals or ages out of the HOURS window.

Switch: .market/buyer_food_shelf.json {"enabled": true, "study": "<id>", "salt": "<salt>"}; missing, unreadable or
anything else is off, and off is the current pick exactly. BUYER_FOOD_SHELF=0 in the environment is off too. Read at
every order, so no restart either way. Arms: sha256(salt:order id), first byte odd is B, fixed before any quote.
