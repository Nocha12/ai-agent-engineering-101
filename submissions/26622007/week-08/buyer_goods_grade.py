"""Goods: price a unit by its grade's chance of breaking, not its SKU's (review/W-20261109-1033-AX취약점루프/weakness-02-buyer.md §5).

saved_cap and value_limit take market_model.break_chance, one rate per SKU over every grade sold. The grade is most of
the risk (market 48 h to 11/09 07:44: grade C broke 31.7%, B 11.3%, A 2.8%), so a grade C unit passes with an A-like
cap: our last 12 h grade C goods kept .242 of list on average against .356 for every deal, at a .407 discount, because
41% broke and a broken unit is refunded and keeps 0.

Arm B takes max(SKU chance, market_model.unit_break_chance(stats, sku, grade)) when the chosen shop's quote names one
grade, so saved_cap's list (1 - 0.30 / (1 - b)) asks a deeper discount of a grade B or C unit (the short warranty cap
reads the grade the same way: "grade C", "Grade C", one grade only). The chance never goes down, so a grade A unit is
priced as today. Arm A keeps the SKU chance. Both arms are recorded in orders.jsonl ("goods_grade"), with the chance B
uses and arm A's limit (limit_a), so the eligible set is the same in both; the record's break_chance is the chance the
limit used (arm B: the grade's). buyer_shop_profile and buyer_rank_pg leave out arm B talks whose limit went down
(lowered()), so the lowered limits set neither a shop's accept band nor its rank for both arms (independent reviews
d85a9e9 I1, 8ca80f5 I1). Only the limit moves, and a lower limit can only mean fewer or cheaper deals. Until the
goods-ladder 809 I3 follow-up (main 11/09 14:58) the buyer memory's trades carried no arm, so arm B's cheaper deals
reached the prices rule_choose, gem_names, my_avg_price, overpriced and item_stats read for both arms, and the shop
chosen next could move with them; from that fix the trade carries trade_mark and priced leaves arm B's lowered deals
out, and hide_unmarked those written before it, without writing the memory again.

Eligible: a round 3 goods order with an id, the chosen shop's quote naming one grade, a SKU chance (enough goods sold),
and no short warranty expected (buyer_short_warranty: its own cap with the grade's chance). Everything else is
untouched and unrecorded. Disjoint from buyer_food_ladder and buyer_food_shelf (food only); buyer_quote_deadline is on
for all goods (both arms). The goods no-fit A/B (buyer_rank_pg, nofit-ab-goods-fixed-0025) ended 11/09 13:29 with its
switch set to nofit false, which leaves rk["nofit"] false on every order, so it is no condition here.

Switch: .market/buyer_goods_grade.json {"enabled": true, "study": "<id>", "salt": "<salt>", "start": <epoch>,
"end": <epoch>}: on only from start until end (the study's ON time and its registry maximum), so arm B stops at end
even if nobody turns the switch off (goods-ladder review 809 I1, same shape). Missing, unreadable, without the window
or anything else is off, and off is the current limit exactly. BUYER_GOODS_GRADE=0 in the environment is off too. Read
at every order, so no restart either way. Arms: sha256(salt:order id), first byte odd is B.
