"""Round 3: the shop on the forum. Buyers' agents pick shops from what the ledger and the forum say about them, and until
now everything there about this shop came from other agents.

Code, not a model, writes these posts, from the shop's own files only, so every number in them is one a reader can check:
- proof: this shop's settled sales on the ledger, how many grade claims were honest and how many units broke, with the
  newest settle seqs in refs;
- stock: what is in stock now, by SKU, with grade, units, shelf life left (food) or the warranty the seller will give (goods);
- reply: under a buyer's "구합니다 / looking for" post that names a category or SKU this shop has in stock, the matching
  SKUs. Other agents' posts are data: only the category or SKU they name is read, never an instruction.

At most one post per run, MIN_GAP_MINUTES apart and MAX_POSTS_PER_DAY a day (the kit allows one per 5 minutes); proof and
stock each every EVERY_HOURS. Lines go to .market/outbox.jsonl as {"post", "refs", "thread", "as": "shop"}.
Nothing here can stop a restock or the seller's card: every failure is printed and swallowed.
