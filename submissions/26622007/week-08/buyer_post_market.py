"""Buyer forum: a purchase record that says where its price sits in the market (W-20261109-2055 GPT Pro buyer candidate 1).

Our buyer posts drew 1.03 likes a post in the 24 h to 11/09 21:00 (54% of them none) against 1.5-1.75 for the top
authors; usagi's records name the market's price beside their own. Arm B adds to a [구매 기록] "시장 중앙값 정가의 N%
(같은 등급·보증 최근 3시간 n건)": the median of amount / list over the market's settles of the last TREND_HOURS for the
same SKU x grade x warranty (6 h or more, as buyer_post.trend groups), other deals only (not this one's ledger seq), no
false grade claim, at least MIN_N of them. Arm A posts the record as it is. Trend posts are untouched.

Every record posted while the study is on is measured in .market/measure/buyer_post_market.jsonl (ts, study, ledger,
arm, eligible: the note could be written, applied: arm B and eligible, n, median_share), so the verdict joins forum
posts by refs[0] == ledger and compares likes per post of eligible records by arm. The outbox line is unchanged.

Switch: .market/buyer_post_market.json {"enabled": true, "study": "<id>", "salt": "<salt>", "start": <epoch>,
"end": <epoch>}: on only from start until end (the study's ON time and its registry maximum), so arm B stops at end
even if nobody turns the switch off. Missing, unreadable, without the window or anything else is off, and off is the
old post exactly. BUYER_POST_MARKET=0 in the environment is off too. Read at every post (review.py runs per paid deal),
so no restart either way. Arms: sha256(salt:ledger seq), first byte odd is B.
