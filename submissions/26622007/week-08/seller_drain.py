"""Cooperative seller drain; not durable task migration or a zero-loss guarantee.

A restart loses what lives in this process only: the talks under way (Seller.open and the SDK's tasks), the units promised
to them and the deals waiting for their payment (StockBook). So first drain:

    echo <seller pid> > .market/seller.drain     # seller_restart.sh does this, then waits, then TERMs

Only the process with that pid drains, so the seller the kit starts again ignores the same file. While draining a new talk
is refused, a talk under way goes on, and every TICK s .market/seller_drain_status.json holds the census; "drained" is
true when no turn is being answered, no unit is promised and no deal waits for its payment (memory writes flushed).
A talk whose hold ran out (HOLD_SECONDS silent) has let its unit go by the shop's own rule: it is "stale", not waited for.
"late" deals and stale SDK talks are counted; "quiet" requires both absent. A deadline may therefore abort a future restart.
