"""Round 3 (patch 3.4/3.5): one free dislike stance on the buyer of a player within BAND of me on the Players board.

The rules allow it: "Within any hour, an account's first 3 new dislike stances on buyers are free" (Patch 3.4) and "One
stance per account on each author". Players = shop ALL + buyer ALL, and 0.3 of buyer ALL is the forum rating as itself
(0 to 1). One account holds one stance per author (likes minus dislikes on that author's posts), and a dislike stance
weighs 1. Measured 11/06 19:41, one stance moved a player's total by about 0.005 (below), so it can decide a swap only
with a player close to me; a wider gap closes only with our own growth (Saved passes about one buyer an hour).
To switch this off, set BAND = 0.

Paid votes are not sent. More votes on one buyer cost unit x (N - 1)^2 (unit = 3% of the largest Book, 3,404,758 on 11/06),
so 3 votes on MJforge cost 13.6M of Book for about 0.0006 more, while the gap to the player above that was 0.013 at 11/06
19:03 (about 40 votes, billions). Book is half of shop ALL and the cash is stock for revenue. So: only -1 votes, only while the market says
the next dislike is free (next_dislike_fee 0), at most MAX_NEW_PER_HOUR new stances an hour (the market's free 3) and
MAX_STANCES opened within STANCE_DAY. Turning a like stance into a dislike takes several -1 votes on that author's posts;
each is a plain -1, not a vote of value -N (the paid "more votes on one buyer"): the 2 votes on buzllightyear at 11/06
19:41 were answered with fee 0 and power_fee 0. Spend per vote and per hour is 0 by construction (MAX_FEE_PER_VOTE, MAX_FEE_PER_HOUR).
Nothing here can stop a restock.
