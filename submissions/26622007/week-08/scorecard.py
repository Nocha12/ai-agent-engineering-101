# The midterm's Round 3 rank (week 9, FIG. 07): each part a percentile among shops or buyers, Players = shop ALL + buyer ALL.

# 12,061 buyer rows) within the board's rounding (0.0005). The rows ranked are those the board scores (all is not None:
# shops with a supply or a deal, house shops included; buyers with a deal), a tie takes the mean rank, a missing value is 0,
# the shop's stars part is stars_rank, and posts count 0.1 of the buyer's ALL. Patch 3.3 (11/05) ranks book (cash profit +
# unsold stock at cost) instead of profit: every shop row of the 80 boards from 03:47:25 KST matches book to the shown
# 3 decimals, every row of the 42 boards up to 03:42:05 matches profit (GPT Pro 4판, checked again on the collector's
# boards). profit stays the fallback for reading a board without book; patch_notes.compare never accepts it as the
# published part.
