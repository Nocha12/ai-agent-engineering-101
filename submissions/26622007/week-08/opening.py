"""Round 3's opening stock, from the GPT Pro review (review/W-20261103-2025/gpt-pro-answer1.md §5, §6):

- Supply opens every 20 minutes for 3 minutes (agent.md); the kit sends at most 10 lines a run, 10 s apart.
- Window 1: phase 1, ten categories near their median price, one unit each (six food with shelf_hours 720 and list
  price <= 30,000, four goods <= 45,000). Windows 2 and 3: phases 2 (ten) and 3 (four), each a conditional candidate:
  once the Round 3 ledger has judge_settles settles, a candidate whose category has settled nothing is dropped, and one
  whose category settles mostly another SKU that fits the same rules is replaced by that SKU.
- Exploration in the first 24 hours stays under explore_budget_worst at worst cost (0.75 x list price).
- Outside a window the hook buys nothing (the kit would wait 90 s per line and then skip it).
pricing.json "opening" holds all of it; the meta-harness may move it like any setting. State: .market/opening_state.json.
