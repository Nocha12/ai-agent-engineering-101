"""The market's patch notes (https://market.ourolabs.ai/rules), read at every meta-harness cycle.

The rules change during Round 3: Patch 3.2 (11/04) added surge cost and renamed profit to cash, Patch 3.3 (11/05) scored
shops by book instead of cash. The scorecard still ranked cash for hours after 3.3, because nothing told Terra and Astra
that the score had changed. check() parses the page's patch list and its scoring bars, remembers when each patch was first
seen (.market/patch_notes.json), and compares the published weights with scorecard.OBJECTIVE, so the pack says:
- new: patches first seen since the previous check (this cycle's news), recent: those first seen in the last day;
- scoring: the published parts and weights; objective_matches false and mismatch when scorecard.OBJECTIVE disagrees.
No model call. A page that cannot be read or parsed gives {"error": ...} and leaves the record alone.

    python patch_notes.py          # prints what a cycle would see (records nothing)
